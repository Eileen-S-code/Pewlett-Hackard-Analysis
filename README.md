# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The company Pewlett Hackard is preparing to employees from the baby boom era's retirement which has been called the "silver tsunami". In order to prepare management wants to determine how many employees are about to retire in each role and how many employees are eligible to be part of the mentorship program.

## Results: 
- Senior roles(engineer and staff) will experience the most loss of employees
- There are very little managers compared to the number of staff
- Since Senior Engineers could also mentor assistant engineers the only category with less than 100 mentors would be technique leaders
- There are no managers that are eligilible for the mentorship program

## Summary: 
1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Since assistant engineers and engineers can be promoted to more senoir roles and staff can be promoted to senior staff, the role of assistant engineer and staff will need to start to be filled first

2. There are no managers eligible to mentor but the rest of the categories will have 75 or more mentors available

3. Additional tables that may provide insight would be to determine the number of employees in each department that will remain after the "silver tsumani" and a table that selects the employees with the longest from_date in the mentorship program to be the ones to train the future employees also a analysis on salaries would help determine how mch monetary space there is to hire or promote new employees
